# Ship Detection using Satellite Imagery

The aim of this project is to accurately classify satellite images that contain ships and furthermore detect the ships on a pixel level in relation to the image as a whole.

Ship detection is a vital aspect of maritime surveillance as it allows the monitoring of maritime traffic, illegal fishing and sea border activities. This is typically carried out using Automated Identification Systems (AIS) which use VHF radio frequencies to wirelessly broadcast the ships location, destination and identity to nearby receiver devices on other ships and land-based systems. 

AIS are very effective at monitoring ships which are legally required to install a VHF transponder, but fail to detect those which are not, and those which disconnect their transponder. So how do you detect these ‘dark’ ships? Using satellite detection!

### Executive Summary

The use of satellite detection of ships will significantly bolster the arsenal of stakeholders in maritime surveillance. Used in conjunction with AIS, satellite detection can flag previously unidentified ships and build up a more accurate picture of the world's seas and oceans that are becoming ever more crowded. Some key challenges that this form of surveillance will attempt to tackle are: illegal fishing operations, maritime accident identification and illegal border immigration. 
In the last decade, numerous companies have deployed survelliance satellites in an attempt to bolster their monitoring capabilities. In turn, detection algorithms such as the one I propose will offer an automated approach to analysing the imagery fed back to earth. 

Next, in a second paragraph, write how you were able to make a data science operationalization of the problem.
For example, you might say that in order to help solve this problem you set out to build a classification ML model in order to automate some process. 

Third, you then write what you did on the project that is a bit more technical.
Here you might say that you took data from [here and make it a link to the original data]() and then ran `a list of models you ran here` in your analysis.
Then end with one sentence that picks what your best model was and how it performed.

Lastly, you say in one or two sentences why this matters. 
For example, now as opposed to before this data analysis, you can now predict X better than Y. 

The goal of this project was to create a `regression/classification` model that was able to predict `what you set out to do`.

> If you are able to swap out the text here with what your case example is you will demonstrate the following:
> 1. You get why what you're doing 'matters'
> 2. You are able to take ill defined problems and turn them into something a data scienst can solve
> 3. You show off your analystical and modeling chops.
> 4. You are able to communicate technical things you do.

### More Information

Below your Executive Summary, you can document whatever you feel would be of interest to a future employer.
Here I would especially suggest diving a bit deeper into your methodology and including images that you are proud of from the project. 
Remember, that people will probably judge your github project page within 45 seconds tops, you want it to look as clean as possible. 

Write documentation that looks like someone you would want to work with.
